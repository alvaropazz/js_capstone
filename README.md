## Design Process

*Forest Man* design process started with the idea of creating a simple and beautiful RPG. The idea is inspired by traditional RPG classics like the Legend of Zelda and classic videogames like Pacman. 
Thanks to the folks in [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/) I was able to find the collection of tiles, spritesheets for enemies and the main character and diffrent objects that are used throughout the game.

## How to play

The objective of the game is to collect all coins in the map.
To move the main character a.k.a. 'Forest Man', you have to press the arrow keys in your keyboard.
